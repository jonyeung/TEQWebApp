# C01 Bird Course Project

Welcome to our project page! Please see Documents/Deliverable_1_v01.pdf for an introduction to the team.

# Navigating the Repo
The src is divided into two sub-directories: backend and frontend. The frontend contains all our HTML pages along with the jQuery scripts and styling sheets.
The backend contains all our backend APIs powered by Node.js.


# Project Planning
Please see the backlogs directory for information regarding the direction of the project. Under product-backlogs you can find our personas and user stories we have created for this project. Under the sprint-backlogs directory you can find the corresponding sprint plan, execution, and burndown chart filed under each sprint's corresponding folder.
## Code Review
During Sprint 4, our team did a code review, evaluating the code written from Sprints 1-3. Under backlogs/sprint-backlogs/Sprint 4 there is a file that outlines the strategy we employed for the code review, as well as the individual comments that each team member wrote following the code review. Additionally, there is a video where we summarized the changes and improvements we made to the code going forward.

# Executing the Project
Navigate through Team2/src/frontend/ . You can run the HTML files locally on a browser of your choice. Currently we have
the following pages and features:
```
- index: landing page of the website, user can sign in with their credentials
- userlist: page that displays a list of all existing users in the system
- registration: page to register a new user with password and access levels
- upload_data: page that allows users to upload iCARE templates into the database
```
# Testing
Unit tests and acceptance tests have been written for the user stories up to the end of Sprint 3. The tests can be found under src/testing .
