# C01 Bird Course Project

Welcome to our project page! Please see Documents/Deliverable_1_v01.pdf for an introduction to the team.

The document for Devliverable 4 (*Verification and Code Review*) can be found in Documents/Deliverable_4_v00.pdf, which includes our sprint reports and our code review for this deliverable.

# Navigating the Repo
The src is divided into two sub-directories: backend and frontend. The frontend contains all our HTML pages along with the jQuery scripts and styling sheets.
The backend contains all our backend APIs powered by Node.js.


# Project Planning
Please see the backlogs directory for information regarding the direction of the project. Under product-backlogs you can find our personas and user stories we have created for this project. Under the sprint-backlogs directory you can find the corresponding sprint plan, execution, and burndown chart filed under each sprint's corresponding folder.
